    <ul>
        <li><strong>Industrial Revolution</strong> - At the beginning of 1750, human activities such as burning of fossil fuels, 
            including coal and oil, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. About 
            2.3 trillion tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere in the 18th century.</li>
        <li><strong>Deforestation</strong> - During the photosynthesis process, trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 
            and release oxygen. Furthermore, carry out the respiration process, which permits carbon to be stored in tree trunks, 
            roots, and soil. When forests are cut down or burned, the carbon dioxide that has been stored in the trees is released 
            into the atmosphere.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Use</strong> - Energy plays an important role in all aspects of our life. The use of water consumption, 
            goods and services, transportation, economic growth, and energy (most from fossil fuels), contribute to climate change. 
            About 84% of U.S. greehouse gas emissions comes from energy demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Pollution</strong> - Pollution is known to come from cars, factories, homes, and power plants that burn fossil 
            fuels such as oil, coal, natural gas, and gasoline. Once entered in the atmosphere, it traps heat around the earth for 
            50-200 years after it is emitted.</li>

        <p>
            Climate change has had a wide-ranging impact on our planet, including increased temperatures, extreme weather events, 
            rising sea levels, animal extinction, and a lack of food. Scientists have previously predicted that the quantity of 
            greenhouse gases produced by human activity would cause an increase in the Earth's average global temperature. 
            As temperatures rise, the hot seasons will definitely prolong while the winter seasons will shorten.
            Furthermore, extreme weather events such as heat waves and droughts will grow more prevalent and stay longer in the
            future. As a result of the lack of precipitation, there will be food shortages. Several nations will very certainly be
            submerged, destroying homes, families, and lives. There will be fewer animals, such as polar bears, because there would 
            be no ice for them to live on. Climate change has a catastrophic influence on the human population and will lead to the 
            extinction of our planet.
